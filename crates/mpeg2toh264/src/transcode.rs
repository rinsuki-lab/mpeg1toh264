//! MPEG-2 to H.264 transcoding.
//!
//! The normal path reconstructs no pixels on the luma path: MPEG-2 coefficient
//! levels are dequantised into orthonormal-DCT values and requantised straight
//! into H.264 levels, with no inverse transform, no motion compensation and no
//! reference frame buffer. Chroma is the exception and is documented in
//! [`crate::h264::chroma`].
//!
//! The exception is the picture that opens a random access point. Its slices
//! are I slices, which carry no reference list, so there is nothing to hang the
//! flat prediction's weights on and it has to be coded with H.264's own intra
//! prediction. DC mode is used throughout, which keeps the prediction a single
//! constant per block and lets the residual stay in the coefficient domain
//! alongside everything else -- but the constant is read back from what a
//! decoder will reconstruct, so that picture, and only that picture, is
//! reconstructed here as well. See [`crate::h264::intra`] and
//! [`crate::h264::reconstruct`].
//!
//! Every output picture is a B slice, even those that were I or P in the source,
//! because the half-sample motion mapping needs bi-prediction and that is only
//! available in B slices. See [`crate::h264::mvmap`].
